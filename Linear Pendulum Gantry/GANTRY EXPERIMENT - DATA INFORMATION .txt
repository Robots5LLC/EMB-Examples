Here you will find data for the gantry only, pendulum only, and complete gantry system (cart+pend). 

The pendulum mass (stick) is 70.3g. Picture "pendulum mass.jpeg" for reference.

The cart mass (moving carriage with pendulum attachment) is approximately 1330g. Picture "pendulum attachment mass (need to add 560g for the moving cart).jpeg" for reference. The addition of ~560g comes from the carriage mass and rack attachment.

For the "gantry_cart_only" data, we simply removed the pendulum (stick) and kept the attachment (encoder and bracket). Picture "cart only configuration, only cart displacement measured.jpeg" shows the setup for this test. Note that the moving mass of this setup is approximately 1330g-70.3g, or around 1260g.

For the "gantry_pend_only" data, we locked the cart with a bracket, so the only motion allowed was pendulum rotation. Picture "pendulum locked, only pend angle measured.jpeg" shows the setup for this test.
To get an approximate start angle (2.5, 5, 10, 20 30 deg), I used a hard stop. I start the data record in the steady-state low position, then manually move against the hardstop, then release. 

Units for the data are: sample number [int], time [s], force [N], motor amplifier current monitor* [V], cart position [m], and pendulum angle [rad]

*: to convert motor amplifier current monitor [V] to motor current [A], multiply by 3.030. This value comes from the motor amplifier monitor output slope (0V for -5A and 3.3V for 5A, 1.65V for 0A). We already subtracted 1.65V so 0V = 0A. Data is raw (unfiltered).

The motor used is our EMB-AM4 with Torque Constant: 27.3 [mNm/A] = 27.3 x 10-3 [Nm/A]. For full datasheet information, check our website.

A 4:1 reduction belt and pulley from motor to pinion. The pinion gear is of Module 1.0, with 20 teeth, therfore the force distance on the pinion is 0.01m.

Motor amplifier is a Maxon ESCON in current mode, set to -5A to +5A.

DAQ is our EMB-DAQ1.
